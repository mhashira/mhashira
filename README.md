Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a 59-year-old professional involved in artwork design for printed circuit boards.
While programming is more of a hobby for me, I've implemented numerous optimizations using VB.NET to streamline my work. 
In my early twenties, I delved into microcontroller circuit design and worked with 86 assembly language.

Since last year, I've been exploring Raspberry Pi and the Python language. 
Although I'm not sure if GitHub is a necessity for me, I'm intrigued by it as a new technological avenue and plan to start learning. 
I enjoy embracing new technologies to enhance my skills and stay current in the ever-evolving landscape. 
Let's connect and learn together! ðŸš€
